    1. **Lowercasing**: Converts text to lowercase for consistency.  
    2. **Removing Punctuation**: Eliminates punctuation marks that do not carry significant meaning.

    6. **Removing URLs and HTML Tags**: Strips out web addresses and HTML code.  
    7. **Handling Emojis and Emoticons**: Removes or converts emojis to their textual equivalents.  
    8. **Handling Contractions**: Expands contractions (e.g., *don't* â†’ *do not*).  
    9. **Text Unification**: Standardizes text variations.  
    10. **Removing Non-ASCII Characters**: Deletes or normalizes characters outside the standard ASCII set.  
    11. **Word Tokenization**: Splits text into individual words.  
    12. **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminates common stop words.
